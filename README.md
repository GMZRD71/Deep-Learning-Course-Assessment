#### Final Deep Learning Problem

In this assessment, we were asked to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that learns to classify images with 10 different labels of fashion pieces.  This code includes the use of one-hot encoding of the y-data to perform the training process correctly and efficiently.  The example included here only has 10 epochs, and it produced relatively accurate results.  The precision, recall and f1-score all averaged in the 90%.  Keras was used to create the neural network and some of the Keras utilities were used for pre-processing and sorting.  The training dataset included 60,000 images while the testing dataset included 10,000 images.
